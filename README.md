# laughing-octo-parakeet

VRChat modification intended to be loaded with Melonloader 0.3.0+.

Allows you to replace the default robot avatars with an avatar of your choice.

Simply add these lines to your MelonPreferences.cfg with a path to a vrca file.
__data avatar files and remote links should work too.

```ini
[Boothing]
AssetBundlePath = "D:\\Path\\To\\boothcat.vrca"
